SFML used as main library and code should be portable to different platforms. Ubuntu is used as main development platform. Documentation and tests are written at the same time as the actual game code. Even small new features should be tested straight away with GTest. All new features are branched and completed before merging with master. 

Basic framework for the code

Classes
	Game (holds pointers to active states, calls active GS)
		GameState (different state-classes inherit from this: game logic, updates, drawing)
	Player (weapons, characters)
		Character (sprite, movement, health)
		Weapon (holds sprite and ammo)
			Ammo (spawned when shot, handles collision detection)
	Map (terrain, wind condition)

Main loop calls Game while there is an active state

Schedule
	Mid meeting
		Characters work (move, jump, shoot on level terrain)
		Bazooka works (gravity)
		Basic sprites made
	Final crunch
		terrain generator
